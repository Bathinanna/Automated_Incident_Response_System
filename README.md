# Automated Incident Response System (AIRS)

The **Automated Incident Response System (AIRS)** is designed to enhance the reliability and availability of services through automated threat detection, real-time incident response, and infrastructure self-healing. By using cutting-edge technologies, AIRS ensures system resilience by automatically identifying and mitigating potential threats, reducing downtime, and improving system reliability.

## Features

- **Automated Threat Detection**: Monitors incoming network traffic for potential threats, including DDoS attacks, intrusions, and other suspicious activities.
- **Real-Time Incident Response**: Automatically initiates remediation steps such as blocking malicious IPs and redeploying affected services to maintain service uptime.
- **Self-Healing Infrastructure**: Implements automated actions like service redeployment and failover to ensure operational continuity during attacks or system failures.
- **Distributed Threat Intelligence**: Shares threat intelligence across a secure, decentralized network to enhance collaborative defense mechanisms.
- **Scalability and Fault Tolerance**: Designed for high availability with automatic scaling, ensuring the system can handle increased loads during security incidents.
- **Comprehensive Logging & Monitoring**: Provides real-time logging of system activities and security events for better visibility, diagnostics, and incident investigation.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core programming language for system development and automation.
- **PySpark**: Used for processing and analyzing large-scale data to detect anomalies in network traffic.
- **ZeroMQ**: Efficient message queuing system for communication between different components of the incident response infrastructure.
- **Crypto Libraries**: Includes cryptographic algorithms like AES and RSA for secure data transmission.
- **Ansible**: Used for automating infrastructure configuration, service deployment, and orchestration.
- **Docker**: Containerization platform to ensure portability and consistency across environments, enhancing the deployment process.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Bathinanna/Automated_Incident_Response_System.git
   cd Automated_Incident_Response_System
   ```

2. **Configure the System**
   Edit `config.ini` to set your specific configurations such as thresholds for requests and time windows.

3. **Run the AIRS**
   Start the Automated Incident Response System using:
   ```bash
   python final.py
   ```

## Usage

Once the system is running, it will:
- Monitor network traffic for incoming data.
- Log any detected threats and share intelligence on the ZeroMQ network.
- Implement self-healing actions if a potential DDoS attack is detected.

You can send sample data to the system to test its functionality using a tool like **Postman** or **cURL**.

## Future Enhancements

As the system develops, future improvements may include:

- **Enhanced Threat Detection**: Integrating more advanced detection algorithms to identify threats more accurately and faster.
- **Cloud Integration**: Extending support to cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure) to scale resources dynamically during high-demand periods.
- **Improved Reporting**: Adding more detailed analytics and real-time reporting features to better visualize system performance and detected incidents.
- **More Self-Healing Actions**: Expanding automated incident responses, such as automatic reconfiguration of network settings or scaling infrastructure when under attack.
- **Advanced Cryptography**: Implementing additional cryptographic algorithms or post-quantum encryption methods to further secure communications.
